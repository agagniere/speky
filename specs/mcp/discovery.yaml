  short: Search and filter requirements
  client_statement: |
    I would like to discover what requirements exist by searching with filters like tags or categories.
    For example, "show me all requirements tagged with 'security'" or "what functional requirements exist?"
    This helps me explore the specification and find related requirements when working on a feature.
  long: |
    The user shall be able to search for requirements using optional filter criteria.

    The MCP server shall expose a tool named `search_requirements` that accepts
    optional filter parameters and returns matching requirements.

    Filter parameters:
    - tag: Filter by tag (exact match, e.g., "input" or "output:pdf"). If the
      tag does not exist in the loaded specifications, an error shall be returned.
    - category: Filter by category (exact match, e.g., "functional"). If the
      category does not exist in the loaded specifications, an error shall be returned.

    If no filters are provided, all requirements shall be returned.

    The response shall be a list of requirement summaries, each containing:
    - id: The unique identifier
    - short: The short description (if present)
    - category: The requirement category
    - tags: List of tags (if present)

    The list shall be sorted alphabetically by ID.

  short: Search and filter tests
  client_statement: |
    I would like to discover what tests exist by searching with filters like category
    or the requirement they validate. For example, "show me all non-functional tests"
    or "which functional tests validate RF03" helps me explore the test suite and
    prepare targeted test campaigns.
  long: |
    The user shall be able to search for tests using optional filter criteria.

    The MCP server shall expose a tool named `search_tests` that accepts
    optional filter parameters and returns matching tests.

    Filter parameters:
    - category: Filter by category (exact match, e.g., "functional"). If the
      category does not exist in the loaded specifications, an error shall be returned.
    - tester_of: Filter by requirement ID — returns only tests that reference
      that requirement in their `ref` field. If the requirement ID does not
      exist, an error shall be returned.

    If no filters are provided, all tests shall be returned.
    Filters can be combined.

    The response shall be a list of test summaries, each containing:
    - id: The unique identifier
    - short: The short description (if present)
    - category: The test category

    The list shall be sorted alphabetically by ID.

  short: List all tags
  client_statement: |
    I would like to discover what tags exist in the specification so I can explore
    requirements by theme. For example, "what tags are used?" helps me understand
    how requirements are organized before I search for specific tags.
  long: |
    The user shall be able to retrieve a list of all tags used in the specification.

    The MCP server shall expose a tool named `list_all_tags` that returns
    all unique tags used across all requirements.

    The response shall be a sorted list of unique tag strings.

    Tags with subtags (e.g., "output:pdf") shall be listed as complete tags,
    not split into parts.

    If no requirements have tags, an empty list shall be returned.

  short: List all IDs
  client_statement: |
    I would like to see all requirement and test IDs that exist in the specification.
    This helps me discover what's available, avoid ID collisions when creating new items,
    and understand the naming conventions used in the project.
  long: |
    The user shall be able to retrieve a list of all requirement and test IDs.

    The MCP server shall expose a tool named `list_all_ids` that returns
    all requirement and test IDs in the specification.

    The response shall be an object with two fields:
    - requirements: Sorted list of all requirement IDs
    - tests: Sorted list of all test IDs

    Each list shall be sorted alphabetically.

    If the specification has no requirements or tests, the corresponding list shall be empty.
