  short: Multiple queries per session
  client_statement: |
    I would like to send multiple queries in one conversation without the overhead of
    reloading YAML files each time. When exploring a specification interactively, I might
    search for tags, then get specific requirements, then check their tests - all in quick
    succession. Fast responses are crucial for a smooth user experience.
  long: |
    The system shall be able to handle multiple tool calls in a single session
    without restarting.

    The server shall keep the specifications loaded in memory and respond to each query
    without reloading the YAML files.

    This allows efficient querying during interactive sessions with an LLM agent.
