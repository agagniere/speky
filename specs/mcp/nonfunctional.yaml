- id: MCP001
  short: Start server with specifications
  long: |
    The system shall be started with one or more specification YAML files
    provided as command-line arguments.

    If the specification files contain validation errors
    (such as missing fields or unknown references),
    the server shall fail to start and display an error message.

  short: Multiple queries per session
  client_statement: |
    I would like to send multiple queries in one conversation without the overhead of
    reloading YAML files each time. When exploring a specification interactively, I might
    search for tags, then get specific requirements, then check their tests - all in quick
    succession. Fast responses are crucial for a smooth user experience.
  long: |
    The system shall be able to handle multiple tool calls in a single session
    without restarting.

    The server shall keep the specifications loaded in memory and respond to each query
    without reloading the YAML files.

    This allows efficient querying during interactive sessions with an LLM agent.

    Queries are received by the server in its standard input,
    and responses are written to its standard output.
