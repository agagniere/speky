  short: Search requirements by tag
  long: |
    The user shall be able to filter requirements by tag and receive
    only requirements matching that exact tag.
  prereq: [TMCP003]
  steps:
  - action: The client calls `search_requirements` with tag `foo`
    sample_lang: json
    sample: |
      {
        "id": 2,

      Verify only requirements tagged with `foo` are returned.
      RF04 must not appear as it has no tags.

- id: TMCP013
  ref: [MCP005]
  short: Search requirements by parameterized tag
  long: |
    The user shall be able to filter requirements by a namespaced tag (e.g., `bar:baz`)
    and receive only requirements matching that exact tag.
  prereq: [TMCP003]
  steps:
  - action: The client calls `search_requirements` with tag `bar:baz`
    sample_lang: json
    sample: |
      {
        "id": 2,
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",

          "arguments": {"tag": "bar:baz"}
        }
      }
  - action: |
      Verify only requirements tagged with the exact value `bar:baz` are returned.
      A tag `bar` alone would not match.
