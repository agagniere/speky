- id: MCP006
  short: List tests validating a requirement
  client_statement: |
    I would like to see which tests validate a specific requirement to understand test coverage.
    When reviewing or modifying a requirement, I need to know what tests will be affected and
    what test procedures exist to validate it.
  long: |
    The user shall be able to query which tests validate a given requirement.

    The MCP server shall expose a tool named `list_testers_of` that accepts
    a requirement ID and returns all tests that reference it in their `ref` field.

    The response shall be a list of test summaries, each containing:
    - id: The unique identifier
    - short: The short description (if present)
    - category: The test category

    The list shall be sorted alphabetically by ID.

    If the requirement has no associated tests, an empty list shall be returned.
    If the requirement ID does not exist, an error shall be returned.

  short: List requirements without test coverage
  client_statement: |
    I would like to know which requirements have no tests validating them, so I can
    identify coverage gaps. When preparing for a release or reviewing a specification,
    I need to quickly find what still needs test procedures written for it.
  long: |
    The user shall be able to retrieve all requirements that have no associated tests.

    The MCP server shall expose a tool named `list_untested_requirements` that returns
    all requirements for which no test references them in its `ref` field.

    An optional `category` parameter allows filtering by category.

    The response shall be a list of requirement summaries, each containing:
    - id: The unique identifier
    - short: The short description (if present)
    - category: The requirement category
    - tags: List of tags (if present)

    The list shall be sorted alphabetically by ID.

    If all requirements have at least one test, an empty list shall be returned.

  short: List requirements referencing another
  client_statement: |
    I would like to see which requirements reference or depend on a specific requirement
    to understand dependency chains and impact analysis. When a requirement changes, I need
    to know what other requirements might be affected.

    The user shall be able to query which requirements reference a given requirement.

    The MCP server shall expose a tool named `list_references_to` that accepts
    a requirement ID and returns all requirements that reference it in their `ref` field.

    The response shall be a list of requirement summaries, each containing:
    - id: The unique identifier
    - short: The short description (if present)
    - category: The requirement category

    The list shall be sorted alphabetically by ID.

    If no requirements reference the given ID, an empty list shall be returned.
    If the requirement ID does not exist, an error shall be returned.
